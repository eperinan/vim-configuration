# My Vim Configuration


## Introduction
This repo is created to develop. You are free to add your own Vim config, I would be glad to add your config as a new branch.
I recommend to read vimrc file and erase everything you dont understand. There are a few comments inside it to help you understand everything.
**Why a vim config repo?**
Well, the main reason is to be able to port my Vim config easily to any enviroment where I am coding. Another reason, it´s that it is very easy to change installed bundles just changing actual branch. Having different branches with different configs gets us different behaviours depending on the programming language we are coding, or, for example, modify our code snippets depending on this language: A for or while loop hasn´t the same syntax in all programming languages.
